tilemantle-native
=================

A very simple repo that generates a tilemantle EXE that can be run on Windows machines without installing Node.js. Assuming you have Node installed on your dev PC and you're running PowerShell, just run the following commands:

```
npm install
.\Build.ps1
```

Yay, new `tilemantle.exe`.
